/* Function: shortestPath
 * 
 * Finds the shortest path between the locations given by start and end in the
 * specified world.	 The cost of moving from one edge to the next is specified
 * by the given cost function.	The resulting path is then returned as a
 * Vector<Loc> containing the locations to visit in the order in which they
 * would be visited.	If no path is found, this function should report an
 * error.
 *
 * In Part Two of this assignment, you will need to add an additional parameter
 * to this function that represents the heuristic to use while performing the
 * search.  Make sure to update both this function prototype and the
 * implementation inside of Trailblazer.cpp.
